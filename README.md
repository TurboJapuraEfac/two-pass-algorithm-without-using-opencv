# two-pass-algorithm-without-using-opencv
Go through the explanation of the two-pass algorithm in the lecture video and lecture slides
and implement it using either Python or C++ languages. You may use the OpenCV library
only for basic operations such as image reads and writes.
Consider that all the input images are binary images. The output should be a colour image
with the labelling of each connected components with different colours
